# ThiinkFast
Thiinkfast is a smart writing tool for ADHD and neurodivergent users. It learns your writing quirks, typos, and phrasing, then auto-corrects them in real time as you type.

ThiinkFast - your hyperpersonalized autocorrect!

📊 Stats That Provoke

🧠 1 in 7 people are estimated to be neurodivergent — including those with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, and more.

📚 Traditional grammar tools often assume a single "correct" way to write, overlooking cognitive diversity.

❌ 68% of neurodivergent users report feeling judged or frustrated by automated writing tools.

⏳ Writing fatigue, over-editing, and anxiety are real — especially when spelling and grammar are constantly red-flagged during the writing flow.


🎯 Purpose-Driven Innovation

ThiinkFast isn't just a grammar tool — it's a writing assistant designed with empathy and adaptability.
It’s built for neurodivergent thinkers who write fast, think visually, and need real-time support without interruption or shame.

✅ Auto-correct that respects flow — fixes errors gently in the background when enabled.

🖍️ Manual correction mode — lets users choose when and how to engage with edits.

🔍 Insight dashboards — track progress and common patterns over time, not just mistakes.

🔄 Adaptive learning — tailors suggestions based on frequent user tendencies and phrasing.

🧠 How It Works


ThinkFast is built to learn from you, not lecture you. As you type, it silently analyzes your writing patterns — spotting frequently misspelled words, common phrasing quirks, and your personal language style. Instead of flagging every mistake with distracting red underlines (which can overwhelm users with ADHD or anxiety), ThinkFast offers an auto-correct mode that gently fixes errors in real time, without interrupting your flow. Over time, it builds a correction model tailored to you — turning repeated mistakes into invisible improvements. Prefer to review edits yourself? Manual mode highlights corrections only when you ask, giving you full control over how and when feedback appears.
