📊 Stats That Provoke

🧠 1 in 7 people are estimated to be neurodivergent — including those with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, and more.

📚 Traditional grammar tools often assume a single "correct" way to write, overlooking cognitive diversity.

❌ 68% of neurodivergent users report feeling judged or frustrated by automated writing tools.

⏳ Writing fatigue, over-editing, and anxiety are real — especially when spelling and grammar are constantly red-flagged during the writing flow.


🎯 Purpose-Driven Innovation

ThinkFast isn't just a grammar tool — it's a writing assistant designed with empathy and adaptability.
It’s built for neurodivergent thinkers who write fast, think visually, and need real-time support without interruption or shame.

✅ Auto-correct that respects flow — fixes errors gently in the background when enabled.

🖍️ Manual correction mode — lets users choose when and how to engage with edits.

🔍 Insight dashboards — track progress and common patterns over time, not just mistakes.

🔄 Adaptive learning — tailors suggestions based on frequent user tendencies and phrasing.
